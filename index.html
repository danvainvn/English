                    My teacher in the SD1803 class at FPT Polytechnic School has a variety of interests.
                    She enjoys eating different kinds of food and staying active through sports.
                    She is also keen on practicing English and watching American films.
                    Her enthusiasm for these activities makes her a lively and engaging teacher.

                <p>
                    In terms of physical fitness, I consider my shape to be average—not particularly good but not bad
                    either.
                    I occasionally engage in physical activity by walking around the park behind my apartment.
                    Although I do not have a regular exercise routine, I walk for about half an hour when I do exercise.
                    Most of the time, I do not engage in any specific workout, yet my body remains relatively in shape.
                </p>

                <img src="images/1215_pepe_chips.gif" alt="">
                <p>
                    Regarding my eating habits, I generally consume inexpensive, random foods,
                    though I do treat myself to more enjoyable meals from time to time.
                    I avoid foods that might negatively impact my health, as they are often harmful and not as
                    affordable as they might seem.
                    Fast food, in particular, should be avoided due to its potential health risks and hidden costs.
                    Unhealthy eating habits include frequent consumption of fast food and skipping meals,
                    while healthy habits involve eating a balanced diet and regular meals.

                    Staying in shape is crucial for overall health and well-being.
                    A balanced diet and regular physical activity contribute to maintaining good health.
                    Additionally, I sleep around 6-7 hours each night, typically going to bed at 11 PM,
                    which helps me keep a balanced routine and supports my overall fitness.

                <p>
                    During my most recent vacation, I traveled to Da Lat with my family.
                    We took a bus there and stayed for a week at a hotel.
                    The journey was comfortable, and the accommodation provided a pleasant base for our activities.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="parts">
                <p>
                    The weather in Da Lat was somewhat foggy and chilly, which was quite different from the usual heat
                    we experience.
                    Despite the cold, the local food was delicious, and the people were notably friendly, enhancing our
                    overall experience.
                    We spent our time visiting various famous tourist spots around the city, enjoying the scenic views
                    and vibrant atmosphere.

                    What I loved most about this vacation was the chance to relax without the stress of work.
                    The only downside was that the week felt too short, and I wished for more time to explore.
                    Da Lat is renowned for its cool climate and picturesque landscapes, which I discovered through my
                    parents.
                    Overall, the tranquility and cool environment of the city made it a memorable getaway.

                    I generally choose my clothes based on the occasion. For casual activities like school or going to
                    the cinema, I prefer informal clothing for its comfort. However, for formal events such as weddings
                    or funerals, I always opt for formal attire to match the event's expectations. Although I find
                    informal clothes more comfortable, I can manage wearing formal clothes when required.

            <div class="parts">
                <p>
                    I don't buy my own clothes; my mother handles this task and usually shops online. Consequently, I
                    don't have a particular interest in sleepwear. My mother's online shopping means that I wear what
                    she selects, rather than choosing myself.
                </p>

                    For specific events, formal attire is essential for showing respect and meeting societal norms.
                    Wearing informal clothes to formal occasions might be seen as inappropriate. At school, wearing a
                    uniform, even if only on Mondays, fosters a sense of equality and discipline. Overall, while I
                    prefer informal clothing for comfort, I understand the importance of dressing appropriately for
                    different settings.

                    For my daily commute between home and school, I use my motorbike, which takes about 10 minutes. This
                    method is convenient and efficient for the short distance I travel. While I prefer riding my
                    motorbike for its agility, I occasionally face challenges during rainy weather when it offers
                    limited protection compared to a car.

                <p>
                    Comparing motorbikes and cars, each mode of transportation has its advantages and disadvantages.
                    Motorbikes are nimble and cost-effective for short trips but lack the protection and cargo space of
                    a car. On the other hand, cars provide greater comfort, safety, and weather protection but are more
                    expensive to maintain and fuel. The choice between the two often depends on personal needs and
                    circumstances.

            </div>
            <div class="parts">
                <p>
                    For longer journeys, such as traveling from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, flying is the best option.
                    Air travel is the fastest and most efficient way to cover the considerable distance between these
                    cities, saving time compared to other modes of transportation like trains or buses. Although I don't
                    have immediate vacation plans, as I find the cost and effort involved discouraging, flying remains
                    the preferred choice for such long trips.
